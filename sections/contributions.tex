% 2. by comparing multiple synthesis methods side by side (subtractive, additive, amplitude modulation, etc.), we explicitly address the lack of diversity in \SynthSelect, and show that loss effectiveness is not universal but context-dependent. 
% This comparative methodology highlights scenarios where specific losses (e.g., DTW\_Envelope for modulated signals, SIMSE\_Spec for subtractive filtering) are most appropriate.

% 3. Our methodology emphasizes reproducibility and scalability. 
% By using differentiable Faust-to-JAX synthesizers and modest computational resources, we create a lightweight experimental platform that can be extended to more complex synthesis techniques in future work, while still being transparent and interpretable in its current form.
